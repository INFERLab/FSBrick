# FSBrick

An information model for representing fault-symptom relationships in HVAC systems built upon Brick (https://github.com/BrickSchema/Brick)

FSBrick is a step towards the vision of an adaptable fault diagnosis framework, where existing fault-symptom relationships are checked and revised everytime a system reconfiguration occurs. FSBrick, in particular, is an information model built on top of Brick. It stores information about fault, fault severity, symptoms, and fault-symptom relationships (in a similar format to one found here: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/17/5581), which are products of all existing fault diagnosis method classes. This repo is a companion piece to a paper 'FSBrick: An information model for representing fault-symptom relationships in HVAC systems,' which delves deeper into the topic introduced earlier.

In this repo, you can find three .xlsx files, which hold data used to complete the ontology coverage analyses in Section 5: Applied Study. The .ttl file is the extension of the existing .ttl Brick file retrieved from https://brickschema.org/ontology.
